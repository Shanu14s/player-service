I have covered the points below
Design a REST API with the following:
It should be possible to register a new player by feeding it with the following:
Player details such as email, password, name, surname, date of birth, address
It should be possible to login the player when provided correct email & password.
A session structure should be created and stored.
It should be possible to logout the player when provided session identifier.
It should be possible to set time limit for a player.
The time limit will be a daily limit on player's active session duration (between login & logout).
Login should not be possible when player reached their time limit and any active player should be logged out upon reaching time limit.
It should not be possible to set limit for an inactive player.
